            <p> LetsVolunteer is a website that helps future volunteers find and sign up to volunteering offers. Our aim is to increase the volunteering activity and raising its awarness! </p>

            <p> Your organisation can be part of this project by registering to be in our database. Once you're entered in the database, users can follow your organisation to keep updated, favorite and sign up to volunteering offers you propose! Once users submitted a request for an activity, you will receive an email from us with all the information and you can then accept the request to confirm the activity scheduled! </p>

            <p> Having your offers as a part of our database will make your organisation more visible to potential volunteers and will help us raising awarness in volunteering!</p>

            <p id="em"> If you want to register and have your organisation represented on our website, please send an email to <em> letsvolunteer_organisations@gmail.com </em>. <br />We look forward hearing from you.</p>
