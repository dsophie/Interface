            <p>
                Let'sVolunteer is a volunteering interface designed for people who wish to volunteer. We make life easier when it comes to finding volunteering activites and signing up for them. The best thing? It's free!
            </p>

            <p>
                We partner with multiple volunteering organisations so you can browse through a large range of offers and find what you're looking for! In return, organisations receive more registrations than ever and can help more people, thanks to you!
            </p>
